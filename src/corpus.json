	"The boy's name wasSantiago . Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned  church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the  sacristy had once stood.   He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and  then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no  wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the  entire next day searching for it.   He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow.  He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more  comfortable pillows.   It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof.   I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and  once again he had awakened before it ended.   He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as  soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his  life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside  in search of food and water. \"They are so used to me that they know my schedule,\" he muttered.  Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who  had become accustomed to their schedule.   But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one,  with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand  what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on  him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes  he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.     But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a  merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only  once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded  that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy  about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.     \"I need to sell some wool,\" the boy told the merchant.   The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the  steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.   \"I didn't know shepherds knew how to read,\" said a girl's voice behind him.   The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia , with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the  Moorish conquerors.   \"Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,\" he answered. During the two hours that  they talked, she told him she was the merchant's daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each  day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the news  from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep.   \"How did you learn to read?\" the girl asked at one point.   \"Like everybody learns,\" he said. \"In school.\"   \"Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?\"   The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl  would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went  wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never  end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was  feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl  with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.   But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and  asked the shepherd to come back the following year.     And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. He was excited, and at the  same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling  their wool.   \"It doesn't matter,\" he said to his sheep. \"I know other girls in other places.\"   But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling  salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of  carefree wandering.     The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun. They never have to  make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that's why they always stay close to me.   The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the  best pastures inAndalusia , they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the  seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives,  and didn't understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just  food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and — once in a  while — their meat.   If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after  most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they've forgotten how to rely  on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.   The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had  been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to  feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of  the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with  the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the  fields. It was the time of day when all ofSpain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and  all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight,  he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.   We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket's weight and warmth.   The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of  walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to  explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary  until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a  simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin,  Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this  was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man's sins. One afternoon, on a  visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn't want to become a  priest. That he wanted to travel.     \"People from all over the world have passed through this village, son,\" said his father. \"They come in  search of new things, but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they  arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was better than  what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they're the same as the people who  live right here.\"   \"But I'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live,\" the boy explained.   \"Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here forever,\" his father  continued.   \"Well, I'd like to see their land, and see how they live,\" said his son.     \"The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel,\" his father said.  \"Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.\"   \"Well, then I'll be a shepherd!\"   His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold  coins.   \"I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance. But use them to buy  your flock. Take to the fields, and someday you'll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women  the most beautiful.\"   And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father's gaze a desire to be able, himself, to  travel the world — a desire that was still alive, despite his father's having had to bury it, over dozens of  years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every  night of his life.     The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that  conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but  none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he  could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his  dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he  had had enough of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances  to be happy. I couldn't have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.   Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before,  in spite of having traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had  only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The  problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the  fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.   Maybe we're all that way, the boy mused. Even me — I haven't thought of other women since I met the  merchant's daughter. Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There,  he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to  prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn't want to think about the possibility that some  other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.   It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again  at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an  old woman who interpreted dreams.     The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was separated from her living room by  a curtain of colored beads. The room's furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of  Jesus, and two chairs.   The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers, and  began quietly to pray.     It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they  also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It  was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away  to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened to  death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took  his hands in hers.   But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. He didn't want his  hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.   \"Very interesting,\" said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy's hands, and then she fell silent.   The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly  pulled his hands away.   \"I didn't come here to have you read my palm,\" he said, already regretting having come. He thought for a  moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too  much importance to his recurrent dream.   \"You came so that you could learn about your dreams,\" said the old woman. \"And dreams are the  language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in  the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I'm going to charge you  for the consultation.\"   Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd always takes his chances  with wolves and with drought, and that's what makes a shepherd's life exciting.   \"I have had the same dream twice,\" he said. \"I dreamed that I was in a field with my sheep, when a child  appeared and began to play with the animals. I don't like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid  of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. I don't  know why. I don't know how animals know the age of human beings.\"   \"Tell me more about your dream,\" said the woman. \"I have to get back to my cooking, and, since you  don't have much money, I can't give you a lot of time.\"   \"The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,\" continued the boy, a bit upset. \"And  suddenly, the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.\"   He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were. But she said  nothing.   \"Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,\" — he said the last three words slowly, so that the old woman would  understand — \"the child said to me, If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.' And, just as she  was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both times.\"   The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully.   \"I'm not going to charge you anything now,\" she said. \"But I want one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.\"   The boy laughed — out of happiness. He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of     a dream about hidden treasure!   \"Well, interpret the dream,\" he said.   \"First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your treasure in exchange for what I am  going to tell you.\"   The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image  of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.   \"It's a dream in the language of the world,\" she said. \"I can interpret it, but the interpretation is very  difficult. That's why I feel that I deserve a part of what you find.   \"And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it  was a child who showed them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich  man.\"   The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn't need to seek out the old woman for this! But then  he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything.   \"I didn't need to waste my time just for this,\" he said.   \"I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It's the simple things in life that are the most  extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn  other arts, such as the reading of palms.\"   \"Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?\"   \"I only interpret dreams. I don't know how to turn them into reality. That's why I have to live off what my  daughters provide me with.\"   \"And what if I never get to Egypt?\"   \"Then I don't get paid. It wouldn't be the first time.\"   And the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already wasted too much time with him.   So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams. He remembered  that he had a number of things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something to eat, he  traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the  new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep were at the gates of  the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend. The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what  made traveling appeal to him — he always made new friends, and he didn't need to spend all of his time  with them. When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary,  they wind up becoming a part of that person's life. And then they want the person to change. If someone  isn't what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how  other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.   He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through  the fields. Three days from now, he would be with the merchant's daughter.     He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page it described a burial ceremony. And  the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought,  he would present one person at a time, so that the reader wouldn't have to worry about memorizing a lot  of names.   When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked the book better; the burial  was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at  his side and tried to strike up a conversation.   \"What are they doing?\" the old man asked, pointing at the people in the plaza.   \"Working,\" the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted to concentrate on his reading.   Actually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchant's daughter, so that she could  see that he was someone who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined the scene  many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared  from back to front. He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most  of them he had read in books, but he would tell them as if they were from his personal experience. She  would never know the difference, because she didn't know how to read.   Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation. He said that he was tired  and thirsty, and asked if he might have a sip of the boy's wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping that the  old man would leave him alone.   But the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book he was reading. The boy was tempted  to be rude, and move to another bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly. So  he held out the book to the man — for two reasons: first, that he, himself, wasn't sure how to pronounce  the title; and second, that if the old man didn't know how to read, he would probably feel ashamed and  decide of his own accord to change benches.   \"Hmm. . . \" said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it were some strange object. \"This is an  important book, but it's really irritating.\"   The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had already read the book. And if the book  was irritating, as the old man had said, the boy still had time to change it for another.   \"It's a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say,\" continued the old man.  \"It describes people's inability to choose their own destinies. And it ends up saying that everyone believes  the world's greatest he.\"   \"What's the world's greatest lie?\" the boy asked, completely surprised.   \"It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives  become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.\"   \"That's never happened to me,\" the boy said. \"They wanted me to be a priest, but I decided to become  a shepherd.\"   \"Much better,\" said the old man. \"Because you really like to travel.\"   \"He knew what I was thinking,\" the boy said to himself. The old man, meanwhile, was leafing through the     book, without seeming to want to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange. He  looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one  had only to cross the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping and chanting  their strange prayers several times a day.   \"Where are you from?\" the boy asked.   \"From many places.\"   \"No one can be from many places,\" the boy said. \"I'm a shepherd, and I have been to many places, but I  come from only one place — from a city near an ancient castle. That's where I was bom.\"   \"Well then, we could say that I was bom in Salem.\"   The boy didn't know where Salem was, but he didn't want to ask, fearing that he would appear ignorant.  He looked at the people in the plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them seemed to  be very busy.   \"So, what is Salem like?\" he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.   \"It's like it always has been.\"   No clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn't in Andalusia. If it were, he would already have heard of it.   \"And what do you do in Salem?\" he insisted.   \"What do I do in Salem?\" The old man laughed. \"Well, I'm the king of Salem!\"   People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it's better to be with the sheep, who don't say  anything. And better still to be alone with one's books. They tell their incredible stories at the time when  you want to hear them. But when you're talking to people, they say some things that are so strange that  you don't know how to continue the conversation.   \"My name is Melchizedek,\" said the old man. \"How many sheep do you have?\"   \"Enough,\" said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life.   \"Well, then, we've got a problem. I can't help you if you feel you've got enough sheep.\"   The boy was getting irritated. He wasn't asking for help. It was the old man who had asked for a drink  of his wine, and had started the conversation.   \"Give me my book,\" the boy said. \"I have to go and gather my sheep and get going.\"   \"Give me one-tenth of your sheep,\" said the old man, \"and I'll tell you how to find the hidden treasure.\"   The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was clear to him. The old woman hadn't  charged him anything, but the old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get  much more money in exchange for information about something that didn't even exist. The old man was  probably a Gypsy, too.     But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, picked up a stick, and began to write in  the sand of the plaza. Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was  momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick for someone his age, the man covered  whatever it was with his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read what the old  man had written in the sand.   There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the names of his father and his mother and  the name of the seminary he had attended. He read the name of the merchant's daughter, which he hadn't  even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.     \"I'm the king of Salem,\" the old man had said.   \"Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?\" the boy asked, awed and embarrassed.   \"For several reasons. But let's say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your  destiny.\"   The boy didn't know what a person's \"destiny\" was.   \"It's what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their  destiny is.   \"At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream,  and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a  mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their destiny.\"   None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he wanted to know what the  \"mysterious force\" was; the merchant's daughter would be impressed when he told her about that!   \"It's a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your destiny. It prepares  your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is  that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the  universe. It's your mission on earth.\"   \"Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant?\"   \"Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is nourished by people's happiness. And also  by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation. All things  are one.   \"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\"   They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the townspeople. It was the old man who  spoke first.   \"Why do you tend a flock of sheep?\"   \"Because I like to travel.\"     The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza. \"When he was a  child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside.  When he's an old man, he's going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable,  at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.\"   \"He should have decided to become a shepherd,\" the boy said.   \"Well, he thought about that,\" the old man said. \"But bakers are more important people than shepherds.  Bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry  bakers than shepherds.\"   The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant's daughter. There was surely a baker in her  town.   The old man continued, \"In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more  important for them than their own destinies.\"   The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page he came to. The boy waited, and then  interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted. \"Why are you telling me all this?\"   \"Because you are trying to realize your destiny. And you are at the point where you're about to give it all  up.\"   \"And that's when you always appear on the scene?\"   \"Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or another. Sometimes I appear in the form of  a solution, or a good idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen.  There are other things I do, too, but most of the time people don't realize I've done them.\"   The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear before a miner, and had taken  the form of a stone. The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he  had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an  emerald. The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one  more stone — justone more — he would find his emerald. Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his  destiny, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to  the miner's foot. The miner, with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone  and threw it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon, and there,  embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful emerald in the world.   \"People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,\" said the old man, with a certain  bitterness. \"Maybe that's why they give up on it so early, too. But that's the way it is.\"   The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure.   \"Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents,\" said the old  man. \"If you want to learn about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your flock.\"   \"What about one-tenth of my treasure?\"   The old man looked disappointed. \"If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll  lose your desire to work toward getting it.\"     The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy.   \"Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,\" sighed the old man. \"In any case, it's good that you've  learned that everything in life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.\"   The old man returned the book to the boy.   \"Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I will tell you how to find the hidden  treasure. Good afternoon.\"   And he vanished around the comer of the plaza.     The boy began again to read his book, but he was no longer able to concentrate. He was tense and  upset, because he knew that the old man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of  bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him.  Sometimes it's better to leave things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing. If he  were to say anything, the baker would spend three days thinking about giving it all up, even though he  had gotten used to the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the  baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building  there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt was in Africa.   \"Can I help you?\" asked the man behind the window.   \"Maybe tomorrow,\" said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his sheep, he'd have enough to get  to the other shore of the strait. The idea frightened him.   \"Another dreamer,\" said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy walk away. \"He doesn't have  enough money to travel.\"   While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and decided he should go back  to being a shepherd. In two years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear  sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields  and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.   He decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible. As he walked past the city's  castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he  could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had  come, to occupy all of Spain.   He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza where he had talked with the  old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a  woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man were at all impressed by the  fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and didn't  understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of  his flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which  were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave  them, they would suffer.     The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, because on it the Moors  had come from the Levant at the eastern end of the Mediterranean.   The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought. He  had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have.  There was also the merchant's daughter, but she wasn't as important as his flock, because she didn't  depend on him. Maybe she didn't even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on  which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it's  because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.   I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten used to my being away, and  so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.   From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come and go from the baker's  shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.   \"That baker. . .\" he said to himself, without completing the thought. The levanter was still getting stronger,  and he felt its force on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell  of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once  left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventure — and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous  of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him  back except himself. The sheep, the merchant's daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were only steps  along the way to his destiny.   The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with him.   \"I'm surprised,\" the boy said. \"My friend bought all the other sheep immediately. He said that he had  always dreamed of being a shepherd, and that it was a good omen.\"     \"That's the way it always is,\" said the old man. \"It's called the principle of favorability. When you play  cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner's luck.\"   \"Why is that?\"   \"Because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny; it whets your appetite with a taste of  success.\"   Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that one was lame. The boy explained that it  wasn't important, since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool.   \"Where is the treasure?\" he asked.   \"It's in Egypt, near the Pyramids.\"   The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. But she hadn't charged him anything.   \"In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone  to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you.\"   Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man. He  remembered something his grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. Like     crickets, and like expectations; like lizards and four-leaf clovers.   \"That's right,\" said the old man, able to read the boy's thoughts. \"Just as your grandfather taught you.  These are good omens.\"   The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he saw. The old man wore a breastplate  of heavy gold, covered with precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the  previous day.   He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves.   \"Take these,\" said the old man, holding out a white stone and a black stone that had been embedded at  the center of the breastplate. \"They are called Urim and Thummim. The black signifies 'yes,' and the white  'no.' When you are unable to read the omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an objective  question.   \"But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is at the Pyramids; that you already knew.  But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.\"   The boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would make his own decisions.   \"Don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else. And don't forget the  language of omens. And, above all, don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion.   \"But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.   \"A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the  world. The lad wandered through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful castle, high  atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.   \"Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering the main room of the castle, saw a hive  of activity: tradesmen came and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra was  playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious food in that part of  the world. The wise man conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours before it was  his turn to be given the man's attention.   \"The wise man listened attentively to the boy's explanation of why he had come, but told him that he  didn't have time just then to explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look around the  palace and return in two hours.   \" 'Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,' said the wise man, handing the boy a teaspoon that  held two drops of oil. As you wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to spill.'   \"The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the  spoon. After two hours, he returned to the room where the wise man was.   \" Well,' asked the wise man, 'did you see the Persian tapestries that are hanging in my dining hall? Did  you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful  parchments in my library?'   \"The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed nothing. His only concern had been not     to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him.   \" 'Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,' said the wise man. 'You cannot trust a man if you  don't know his house.'   \"Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his exploration of the palace, this time observing  all of the works of art on the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all around him, the  beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise  man, he related in detail everything he had seen.   \" 'But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?' asked the wise man.   \"Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone.   \" 'Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,' said the wisest of wise men. 'The secret of  happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.' \"   The shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old king had told him. A shepherd may like  to travel, but he should never forget about his sheep.   The old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together, made several strange gestures over the  boy's head. Then, taking his sheep, he walked away.     At the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors. From atop its walls, one can catch a  glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt the  levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new owner and excited by so  much change. All they wanted was food and water.   Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port. He would never again see  the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was  his work.   The gods should not have desires, because they don't have destinies. But the king of Salem hoped  desperately that the boy would be successful.   It's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name, he thought. I should have repeated it for him.  Then when he spoke about me he would say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.   He looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, \"I know it's the vanity of vanities, as you said, my  Lord. But an old king sometimes has to take some pride in himself.\"     How strange Africa is, thought the boy.   He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier.  Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just a few hours  he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their faces covered, and priests that climbed to the  tops of towers and chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on     the ground.   \"A practice of infidels,\" he said to himself. As a child in church, he had always looked at the image of  Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these kneeling  at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them.   Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one detail, which could keep him  from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic was spoken in this country.   The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that had been served at the next  table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.   But he didn't need to worry about that right now. What he had to be concerned about was his treasure,  and how he was going to go about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his  pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone.  Before long, maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a breastplate of  gold, wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep.   The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy was crossing the strait, he had thought  about omens. Yes, the old man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent  in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning which path he should take by observing the  ground and the sky. He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a snake was  nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there was water in the area. The sheep had taught him  that.   If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and that made him feel better. The  tea seemed less bitter.   \"Who are you?\" he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.   The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and someone had appeared.   \"How come you speak Spanish?\" he asked. The new arrival was a young man in Western dress, but the  color of his skin suggested he was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.   \"Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We're only two hours from Spain.\"   \"Sit down, and let me treat you to something,\" said the boy. \"And ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate  this tea.\"   \"There is no wine in this country,\" the young man said. \"The religion here forbids it.\"   The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He almost began to tell about his treasure,  but decided not to do so. If he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for  taking him there. He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even  have yet.   \"I'd like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as my guide.\"   \"Do you have any idea how to get there?\" the newcomer asked.     The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening attentively to their conversation. He felt  uneasy at the man's presence. But he had found a guide, and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity.   \"You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,\" said the young man. \"And to do that, you need money. I  need to know whether you have enough.\"   The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who had said that, when you really  want something, the universe always conspires in your favor.   He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The owner of the bar came over  and looked, as well. The two men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated.   \"Let's get out of here\" said the new arrival. \"He wants us to leave.\"   The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him  in an angry stream of words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign  country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. \"He wanted your  money,\" he said. \"Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.\"   The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous situation. He took out his money  and counted it.   \"We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,\" said the other, taking the money. \"But I have to buy two  camels.\"   They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere there were stalls with items for  sale. They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were thousands of  people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed  alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all his money. He  thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about  the customs of the strange land he was in.   \"I'll just watch him,\" he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his friend.   Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The  scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy  promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword.   \"Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,\" he said to his friend. Then he realized that he  had been distracted for a few moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had  suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he would find. He  continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn around.   All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and buying, and the aroma of  strange foods. . . but nowhere could he find his new companion.   The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident. He  decided to stay right there and await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby  tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the  ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and left.     The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through its trajectory for some time, until it was  hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that  morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting  with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through  the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange  land, where he couldn't even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not  even the money to return and start everything over.   All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was feeling sorry for himself, and  lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically.   He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front of his own sheep. But the  marketplace was empty, and he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and  because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams.   When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. People saw me coming and  welcomed me, he thought. But now I'm sad and alone. I'm going to become bitter and distrustful of  people because one person betrayed me. I'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because  I never found mine. And I'm going to hold on to what little I have, because I'm too insignificant to  conquer the world.   He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich  he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old  man had given him.   As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had exchanged six sheep for two  precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return  ticket. But this time I'll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them  in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns  are full of thieves.   Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust  that man. \"I'm like everyone else — I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what  actually does.\"   He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were  his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man.   \"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it,\" he had said.   The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty  marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones  were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy's past.   \"They're called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens.\" The boy put the stones  back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions,  and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man's blessing was still with  him.   He took out one of the stones. It was \"yes.\"     \"Am I going to find my treasure?\" he asked.   He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As he did so, both of them  pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was  a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he  saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.   \"Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,\" the old king had said.   An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He  didn't consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned  that there were certain things one shouldn't ask about, so as not to flee from one's own destiny. \"I  promised that I would make my own decisions,\" he said to himself.   But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident.  He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn't a strange  place; it was a new one.   After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the  Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how  different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the  moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he  would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen  one like it before. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of  himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure.   \"I'm an adventurer, looking for treasure,\" he said to himself.     He was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace, and  life in the plaza was about to resume.   Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of being  saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in  search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the  night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.   He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a  candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was  about, and ready to begin a day's work. His smile reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old  king he had met. \"This candy merchant isn't making candy so that later he can travel or marry a  shopkeeper's daughter. He's doing it because it's what he wants to do,\" thought the boy. He realized that  he could do the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his  destiny. Just by looking at them. It's easy, and yet I've never done it before, he thought.   When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day.  The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized  that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.   And they had understood each other perfectly well.     There must be a language that doesn't depend on words, the boy thought. I've already had that  experience with my sheep, and now it's happening with people.   He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and  weren't really new, but that he had never perceived before. And he hadn't perceived them because he  had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I  can learn to understand the world.   Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in  that way would he be able to read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds  know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessons  he had learned with his sheep.   \"All things are one,\" the old man had said.     The crystal merchant awoke with the day, and felt the same anxiety that he felt every morning. He had  been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed.  Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell  crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab merchants, French  and English geologists, German soldiers who were always well-heeled. In those days it had been  wonderful to be selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women  at his side as he grew older.   But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and  business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill.  And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.   But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal  pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.   He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street. He had done this  for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in  front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that  the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes  until the boy moved on.     A card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop. The boy saw  a man appear behind the counter.   \"I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,\" said the boy. \"The way they look now,  nobody is going to want to buy them.\"   The man looked at him without responding.   \"In exchange, you could give me something to eat.\"     The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going to have to make a decision. In his  pouch, he had his jacket — he certainly wasn't going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he  began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, as he was  doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal.   When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to eat. \"Let's go and have some  lunch,\" said the crystal merchant.   He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small cafe nearby. As they sat down at the only table in  the place, the crystal merchant laughed.   \"You didn't have to do any cleaning,\" he said. \"The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person.\"   \"Well then, why did you let me do it?\" the boy asked.   \"Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.\"   When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, \"I'd like you to work in my shop. Two  customers came in today while you were working, and that's a good omen.\"   People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don't know what they're saying. Just  as I hadn't realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep.   \"Do you want to go to work for me?\" the merchant asked.   \"I can work for the rest of today,\" the boy answered. \"I'll work all night, until dawn, and I'll clean every  piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.\"   The merchant laughed. \"Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year. . . even if you earned a good  commission selling every piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are  thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.\"   There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep. No sound from the  bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no  adventure, no old kings or destinies, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent  because the boy's soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the cafe, wishing that he had  died, and that everything would end forever at that moment.   The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly  disappeared.   \"I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, my son,\" said the crystal merchant.   The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked up his pouch.   \"I'll work for you,\" he said.   And after another long silence, he added, \"I need money to buy some sheep.\"   PART TWO     The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn't  exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind  the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.   But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the  boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money  aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day as he had been, he  would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.   \"I'd like to build a display case for the crystal,\" the boy said to the merchant. \"We could place it outside,  and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill.\"   \"I've never had one before,\" the merchant answered. \"People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces  will be broken.\"   \"Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a  snake. But that's the way life is with sheep and with shepherds.\"   The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He was selling better than ever. . .  as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier's major attractions.   \"Business has really improved,\" he said to the boy, after the customer had left. \"I'm doing much better,  and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?\"   \"Because we have to respond to omens,\" the boy said, almost without meaning to; then he regretted  what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.   \"It's called the principle of favorability, beginner's luck. Because life wants you to achieve your destiny,\"  the old king had said.   But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy's very presence in the shop was an omen,  and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired  the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that  sales wouldn't amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He had assumed he would  soon return to his sheep.   \"Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?\" he asked, to get away from the business of the display.   \"Because I've always heard about them,\" the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream. The  treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.   \"I don't know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids,\" said  the merchant. \"They're just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.\"   \"You've never had dreams of travel,\" said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the  shop.   Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.     \"I don't much like change,\" he said. \"You and I aren't like Hassan, that rich merchant. If he makes a  buying mistake, it doesn't affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.\"   That's true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.   \"Why did you think we should have the display?\"   \"I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as  much to help it as it's doing to help us. It's called the principle of favorability. Or beginner's luck.\"   The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, \"The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us  just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God.  The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.\"   He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He was a devout man, and,  even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.   \"What's the fifth obligation?\" the boy asked.   \"Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,\" the merchant answered. \"The fifth  obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city  of Mecca.   \"Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together  enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I'd be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to  make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals  are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca.  Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people  making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.   \"All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the  doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had  traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the  streets of Tangier buying his leather.\"   \"Well, why don't you go to Mecca now?\" asked the boy.   \"Because it's the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That's what helps me face these days that are all  the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible cafe. I'm afraid  that if my dream is realized, I'll have no reason to go on living.   \"You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you're different from me, because you want to  realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca. I've already imagined a thousand times crossing  the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before allowing  myself to touch it. I've already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me,  and the conversations and prayers we would share. But I'm afraid that it would all be a disappointment,  so I prefer just to dream about it.\"   That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not everyone can see his dreams  come true in the same way.     Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop. The boy  estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet  another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business  with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the  marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as  distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his  work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.   \"You must always know what it is that you want,\" the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now  working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief,  and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.   He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about  the language without words. . . and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill,  complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The  boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.   \"Let's sell tea to the people who climb the hill.\"   \"Lots of places sell tea around here,\" the merchant said.   \"But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses. I  have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men.\"   The merchant didn't respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers and closing the shop, he invited  the boy to sit with him and share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.   \"What is it you're looking for?\" asked the old merchant.   \"I've already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the money to do so.\"   The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply.   \"I've had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know  about crystal. I know its dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to  expand. And then I'll have to change my way of life.\"   \"Well, isn't that good?\"   \"I'm already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had  wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than  they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasn't been too bad. The shop is  exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don't want to change anything, because I don't know how to  deal with change. I'm used to the way I am.\"   The boy didn't know what to say. The old man continued, \"You have been a real blessing to me. Today,  I understand something I didn't see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don't want anything  else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I  have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I'm going to feel worse than I did     before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don't want to do  so.\"   It's good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the boy to himself.   They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They were conversing in Arabic, and  the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he thought that his  sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world. But they could never have taught  him Arabic.   There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can't teach me, thought the boy as he  regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn't that  they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.   \"Maktub,\" the merchant said, finally.   \"What does that mean?\"   \"You would have to have been bom an Arab to understand,\" he answered. \"But in your language it  would be something like It is written.' \"   And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the  crystal glasses. Sometimes, there's just no way to hold back the river.     The men climbed the hill, and they were tired when they reached the top. But there they saw a crystal  shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal  glasses.   \"My wife never thought of this,\" said one, and he bought some crystal — he was entertaining guests that  night, and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man remarked that  tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third  said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers.   Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the hill to see the shop that was  doing something new in a trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but  they weren't at the top of a hill, and they had little business.   Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to import enormous quantities of  tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new.   And, in that way, the months passed.     The boy awoke before dawn. It had been eleven months and nine days since he had first set foot on the  African continent.   He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this day. He put his headcloth in  place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs     silently.   The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass.  Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah.   He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the wind that brought the scent of  the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few  moments, regarding what he had withdrawn.   It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a  license to import products from Africa into his own country.   He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then the two went off to have some  more tea.   \"I'm leaving today,\" said the boy. \"I have the money I need to buy my sheep. And you have the money  you need to go to Mecca.\"   The old man said nothing.   \"Will you give me your blessing?\" asked the boy. \"You have helped me.\" The man continued to prepare  his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the boy.   \"I am proud of you,\" he said. \"You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But you know that I'm  not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you're not going to buy your sheep.\"   \"Who told you that?\" asked the boy, startled.   \"Maktub \" said the old crystal merchant.   And he gave the boy his blessing.     The boy went to his room and packed his belongings. They filled three sacks. As he was leaving, he  saw, in the comer of the room, his old shepherd's pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought  of it for a long time. As he took his j acket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street,  the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.   It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had  thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting aside enough  money so that he could return to Spain with pride.   \"Never stop dreaming,\" the old king had said. \"Follow the omens.\"   The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that the old king was  nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.   I'm going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even though the sheep didn't teach  me to speak Arabic.     But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that  everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve  things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and  as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he  felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.   \"When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,\" the old king had said.   But the old king hadn't said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts, or about people who  know what their dreams are but don't want to realize them. The old king hadn't told him that the  Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten  to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you  should buy it.   The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs and found the  merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea  from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he  saw for the first time that the old merchant's hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He  remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and  nowhere to go — that smile had also been like the old king's smile.   It's almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of these people has ever  met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to  realize their destiny.   He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn't want to cry with the other people  there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident in  himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.   \"But I'm going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again.\" He said that to himself with  certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a  dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that  wasn't really his dream.   Who knows. . . maybe it's better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through  life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thurnmim in  his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By coincidence — or maybe it  was an omen, the boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn't  there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea.   I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for sheep, and I  haven't forgotten how that's done. But maybe I'll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in  Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise  king.   The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the  Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours  closer to his treasure. . . the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter.   I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I understand sheep; they're no longer a problem,  and they can be good friends. On the other hand, I don't know if the desert can be a friend, and it's in the     desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I don't find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough  money, and all the time I need. Why not?   He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He could always  become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and  he had met with a king. That doesn't happen to just anyone!   He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant's suppliers  transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his  hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the way to his treasure.   \"I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their destiny,\" the old king had told him.   What could it cost to go over to the supplier's warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far  away?     The Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of animals, sweat, and dust; it was part  warehouse, part corral. I never thought I'd end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed through the  pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university, and here I am in a corral.   But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the  one true language of the universe. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world's religions, and now it  was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn't  yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions, but his studies had taken him to  a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an  alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only about themselves, and almost  always refused to help him. Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master  Work — the Philosopher's Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.   He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher's  Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all  the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous  Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that  he had discovered the Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly  impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of  his — retorting from an archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was  possessed of exceptional powers.   \"He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,\" his friend had said. \"And people say that he is two hundred years old,  and is able to transform any metal into gold.\"   The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his commitments and pulled together  the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside,  a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through  Al-Fayoum.   I'm going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the odor of the animals became a  bit more tolerable.     A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman.   \"Where are you bound?\" asked the young Arab.   \"I'm going into the desert,\" the man answered, turning back to his reading. He didn't want any  conversation at this point. What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because  the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.   The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in Spanish. That's good,  thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum,  there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do.     \"That's strange,\" said the boy, as he tried once again to read the burial scene that began the book. \"I've  been trying for two years to read this book, and I never get past these first few pages.\" Even without a  king to provide an interruption, he was unable to concentrate.   He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one thing:  making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving  into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the  decision.   When I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I'd wind up working in a crystal shop, he  thought. And joining this caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery  tome.   Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and had looked irritated when the  boy had entered. They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation.   The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn't want to do anything that might make him look like the  Englishman. He took Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.   The stranger shouted, \"Urim and Thummim!\"   In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.   \"They're not for sale,\" he said.   \"They're not worth much,\" the Englishman answered. \"They're only made of rock crystal, and there are  millions of rock crystals in the earth. But those who know about such things would know that those are  Urim and Thummim. I didn't know that they had them in this part of the world.\"   \"They were given to me as a present by a king,\" the boy said.   The stranger didn't answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket, and took out two stones that were the  same as the boy's.   \"Did you say a king?\" he asked.   \"I guess you don't believe that a king would talk to someone like me, a shepherd,\" he said, wanting to     end the conversation.   \"Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to  acknowledge. So, it's not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.\"   And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn't understand what he was talking about, \"It's in the Bible.  The same book that taught me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of divination  permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden breastplate.\"   The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.   \"Maybe this is an omen,\" said the Englishman, half aloud.   \"Who told you about omens?\" The boy's interest was increasing by the moment.   \"Everything in life is an omen,\" said the Englishman, now closing the journal he was reading. \"There is a  universal language, understood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of that universal  language, among other things. That's why I'm here. I have to find a man who knows that universal  language. An alchemist.\"   The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.   \"You're in luck, you two,\" the fat Arab said. \"There's a caravan leaving today for Al-Fayoum.\"   \"But I'm going to Egypt,\" the boy said.   \"Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,\" said the Arab. \"What kind of Arab are you?\"   \"That's a good luck omen,\" the Englishman said, after the fat Arab had gone out. \"If I could, I'd write a  huge encyclopedia just about the wordsluck anticoincidence. It's with those words that the universal  language is written.\"   He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he  asked the boy if he, too, were in search of the alchemist.   \"I'm looking for a treasure,\" said the boy, and he immediately regretted having said it. But the Englishman  appeared not to attach any importance to it.   \"In a way, so am I,\" he said.   \"I don't even know what alchemy is,\" the boy was saying, when the warehouse boss called to them to  come outside.     \"I'm the leader of the caravan,\" said a dark-eyed, bearded man. \"I hold the power of life and death for  every person I take with me. The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.\"   There were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four hundred animals — camels, horses,  mules, and fowl. In the crowd were women, children, and a number of men with swords at their belts and  rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books. There was a     babble of noise, and the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he  was saying.   \"There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own God. But the only God I serve is Allah,  and in his name I swear that I will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But I  want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no  matter what. In the desert, disobedience means death.\"   There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God. The boy swore  to Jesus Christ. The Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would  have. The people were also praying to heaven for protection.   A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. The boy and the Englishman had  bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman's camel,  loaded down as he was with the cases of books.   \"There's no such thing as coincidence,\" said the Englishman, picking up the conversation where it had  been interrupted in the warehouse. \"I'm here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who. . . \"   But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the Englishman was saying. The boy  knew what he was about to describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the  same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring dream, that had  brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant,  and...   The closer one gets to realizing his destiny, the more that destiny becomes his true reason for being,  thought the boy.   The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted when the sun was at its  strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent  most of his time with his books.   The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert. Now everything  was quite different from how it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion and  shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of the  guides and the merchants.   But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the hoofbeats of the animals.  Even the guides spoke very little to one another.   \"I've crossed these sands many times,\" said one of the camel drivers one night. \"But the desert is so  huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.\"   The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set foot in the desert before.  Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.   I've learned things from the sheep, and I've learned things from crystal, he thought. I can learn something  from the desert, too. It seems old and wise.   The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same  wind blowing in his face. It reminded him of the wool from his sheep. . . his sheep who were now seeking     food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they always had.   \"They're not my sheep anymore,\" he said to himself, without nostalgia. \"They must be used to their new  shepherd, and have probably already forgotten me. That's good. Creatures like the sheep, that are used  to traveling, know about moving on.\"   He thought of the merchant's daughter, and was sure that she had probably married. Perhaps to a baker,  or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting stories — after all, he probably wasn't  the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver's comment: maybe he  was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people. \"Hunches,\"  his mother used to call them. The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden  immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and  we are able to know everything, because it's all written there.   \"Maktub\" the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.   The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a  boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the  sand was too fine for the animals' hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In  some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places,  and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight  themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall ill or die,  the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.   But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the  caravan moved toward the same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its  course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in  the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other  people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed in  reading his books.   The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey. But he  found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned  to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away. Although the  boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something  important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.   He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At night, as they sat around the  fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd.   During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.   \"I used to live near El Cairum,\" he said. \"I had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not  at all until I died. One year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the  only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and that made me feel good.   \"One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its banks. It was something that I thought  could happen only to others, never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the  flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I thought that everything I owned would  be destroyed.     \"The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a living. So now I'm a camel driver. But  that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are  capable of achieving what they need and want.   \"We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it's our life or our possessions and property. But this  fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the  same hand.\"   Sometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had something that the other needed — as if  everything were indeed written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers exchanged  information about windstorms, and told stories about the desert.   At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were Bedouins who did surveillance along  the caravan route. They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in silence and  departed the same way, dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver  came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. \"There are rumors of tribal wars,\" he told  them.   The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, even though no one said  anything. Once again he was experiencing the language without words. . . the universal language.   The Englishman asked if they were in danger.   \"Once you get into the desert, there's no going back,\" said the camel driver. \"And, when you can't go  back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah, including  the danger.\"   And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: \"Maktub\"   \"You should pay more attention to the caravan,\" the boy said to the Englishman, after the camel driver  had left. \"We make a lot of detours, but we're always heading for the same destination.\"   \"And you ought to read more about the world,\" answered the Englishman. \"Books are like caravans in  that respect.\"   The immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster. The days had always been silent,  but now, even the nights — when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — had also  become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer  be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan.   The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night, sleeping together in the  center as protection against the nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the  group.   The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the boy, and they took a walk along the  dunes surrounding the encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the Englishman the story of  his life.   The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the  boy began working there.     \"That's the principle that governs all things,\" he said. \"In alchemy, it's called the Soul of the World. When  you want something with all your heart, that's when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It's always a  positive force.\"   He also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on the face of the earth had a soul,  whether mineral, vegetable, or animal — or even just a simple thought.   \"Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because the earth is alive. . . and it has a soul. We  are part of that soul, so we rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you probably  realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success.\"   The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands. \"I have  watched the caravan as it crossed the desert,\" he said. \"The caravan and the desert speak the same  language, and it's for that reason that the desert allows the crossing. It's going to test the caravan's every  step to see if it's in time, and, if it is, we will make it to the oasis.\"   \"If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage, but without understanding that  language, this journey would have been much more difficult.\"   They stood there looking at the moon.   \"That's the magic of omens,\" said the boy. \"I've seen how the guides read the signs of the desert, and  how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul of the desert.\"   The Englishman said, \"I'd better pay more attention to the caravan.\"   \"And I'd better read your books,\" said the boy.     They were strange books. They spoke about mercury, salt, dragons, and kings, and he didn't understand  any of it. But there was one idea that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are the  manifestation of one thing only.   In one of the books he learned that the most important text in the literature of alchemy contained only a  few lines, and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald.   \"It's the Emerald Tablet,\" said the Englishman, proud that he might teach something to the boy.   \"Well, then, why do we need all these books?\" the boy asked.   \"So that we can understand those few lines,\" the Englishman answered, without appearing really to  believe what he had said.   The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists. They were men who  had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed that, if a  metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left  would be the Soul of the World. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face  of the earth, because it was the language with which all things communicated. They called that discovery  the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid.     \"Can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language?\" the boy asked.   \"You have a mania for simplifying everything,\" answered the Englishman, irritated. \"Alchemy is a serious  discipline. Every step has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.\"   The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir of Life, and that it cured all  illnesses; it also kept the alchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the Philosopher's  Stone.   \"It's not easy to find the Philosopher's Stone,\" said the Englishman."
